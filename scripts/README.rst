   If you want some interactivity without the need of installing anything, it's 
   strongly recommended to click the badge above to open the notebooks in Colab.

   If you'd like to download the notebooks using the link below, it's minimally required 
   to have ``cofi``, ``jupyter-lab`` and ``matplotlib`` installed::

      conda create -n cofi_env python=3.10
      conda activate cofi_env
      conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
      conda install matplotlib
      pip install cofi
