# CoFI examples

[CoFI](https://github.com/inlab-geo/cofi) (Common Framework for Inference) is an open-source 
initiative for interfacing between generic inference algorithms and specific geoscience problems.

This repository contains examples for running inversion algorithms using CoFI.

## Getting started

### Step 1. Get `cofi`

(Strongly recommended) Create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with your other projects:

```console
$ conda create -n cofi_env scipy jupyterlab
$ conda activate cofi_dev
```

Install `cofi` with:

```console
$ pip install cofi
```

### Step 2. Get the examples

Clone this repository:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/inlab-geo/cofi-examples.git
```

### Step 3. Run it!

Open up Jupyter-lab:

```console
$ cd cofi-examples
$ jupyter-lab
```

Run through examples and have fun!

## Contribution

Read `CoFI`'s documentation "Advanced Usage" section for how you can add your own forward examples.
