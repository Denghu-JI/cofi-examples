   :class: tip

   If you want some interactivity without the need of installing anything, it's 
   strongly recommended to 
   `open the notebooks in Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/inlab-geo/cofi-examples/blob/main/index.ipynb>`_.

   If you'd like to download the notebooks and run them locally, you'll need to 
   install cofi and fork the examples repository.
   Check `here <https://github.com/inlab-geo/cofi-examples/blob/main/README.md>`_
   for full instructions.
